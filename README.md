# BF550: Chronic Inflammation Biomarkers Analysis

This repository contains the analysis workflow, scripts, and results for a project focusing on identifying **shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** between chronic inflammatory conditions, specifically **Psoriasis** and **Crohn's Disease**, using public gene expression datasets (GSE102133, GSE13355, GSE14905, GSE75214). The goal is to discover common biological mechanisms and potential biomarkers underlying these diseases.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into four main directories:

| Directory | Content Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `processed_data/` | Contains the cleaned, normalized, and pre-processed gene expression matrices used as input for the analysis scripts. |
| `scripts/` | Contains all the R and Python scripts necessary to reproduce the data processing, differential expression, and network/enrichment analyses. |
| `results/` | Stores all figures (PNGs) and summarized data tables (CSVs) generated by the analysis scripts. |
| `README.md` | This file. |

---

## Scripts Directory Details

The `scripts/` directory is logically divided by language and function.

### `scripts/R/`

These R scripts perform the core statistical analyses, including normalization, **Differential Expression (DE) analysis**, and initial data processing for each dataset.

* `complete_analysis_GSE102133.R`
* `complete_analysis_GSE13355.R`
* `complete_analysis_GSE14905.R`
* `complete_analysis_GSE75214.R`

### `scripts/python/`

These Python scripts are used for data wrangling, metadata preparation, and generating the final visualization and enrichment results.

| Script Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `create_gseXXXXX_metadata.py` | Scripts used to parse and standardize metadata for the respective GSE datasets before analysis. |
| `de_analysis_figures.py` | Takes the DE results from the R scripts and generates the PCA plots, volcano plots, heatmaps, and Venn diagrams for **Figure 2** analysis. |
| `create_figure5_enrichment.py` | Performs Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis, constructs the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, and identifies hub genes for **Figure 5** analysis. |

---

## Results Directory Details

The `results/` directory stores the final output, organized by the figure number they contribute to in the final report.

### `results/Figure2_DE_Analysis/`

This folder contains all figures and summary data related to Differential Expression and initial sample comparisons.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Figure2A_PCA_Psoriasis.png` | PCA plot for Psoriasis dataset. |
| `Figure2B_PCA_Crohns.png` | PCA plot for Crohn's Disease dataset. |
| `Figure2_CD_Volcano.png` | Volcano plots showing DEGs. |
| `Figure2E_Venn.png` | Venn diagram illustrating shared DEGs between Psoriasis and Crohn's Disease. |
| `Figure2_FG_Heatmaps.png` | Heatmaps of top DEGs. |
| `shared_deg_genes.csv` | List of genes found to be significantly differentially expressed in *both* conditions. |
| `Figure2_Combined_Summary.png` | Summary graphic combining key findings from Figure 2. |

### `results/Figure5_Enrichment_PPI/`

This folder contains the results of the functional and network analysis focusing on the shared DEGs.

## Running the Analysis

To completely reproduce the results and figures:

1.  **Prepare Data (Pre-requisite):** Ensure your input data files are clean and placed in the `processed_data/` directory.
2.  **Run R Scripts:** Execute the scripts in `scripts/R/` to perform the core differential expression analysis for each dataset.
3.  **Generate Figure 2:** Run `scripts/python/de_analysis_figures.py` to create all figures and the `shared_deg_genes.csv` for the DE analysis.
4.  **Generate Figure 5:** Run `scripts/python/create_figure5_enrichment.py` to perform the complex network and enrichment analyses and generate the final figures and data tables for the `Figure5_Enrichment_PPI/` folder.
